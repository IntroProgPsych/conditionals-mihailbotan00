# You are tasked with creating a simple grading system for a class. 
# Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input
#  and calculates and prints its corresponding letter grade based on the following grading scale:

# 90 or above: A
# 80-89: B
# 70-79: C
# 60-69: D
# Below 60: F
grade = int(input("Student score: "))

if grade>=90:
    print("A")
if grade>=80 and grade<90:
    print("B")
if grade>=70 and grade<80:
    print("C")
if grade>=60 and grade<70:
    print("D")
if grade<60:
    print("F")
